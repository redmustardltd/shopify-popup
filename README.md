This is a Shopify Liquid template that displays a discount popup on a product page. It's designed to show a discount message and code to users who are about to leave the page. The popup appears either when the user's mouse leaves the window (an `exit intent`), or after a certain amount of time specified in the `popup_timeout` setting.

The code first checks whether the product being viewed has a certain tag (specified in the `popup_tag` setting) and whether the `show_discount_popup` setting is true. If both of these conditions are met, the code displays a div element with the class `rm-exit-intent-popup`. This div contains the actual popup message, which includes an image, a message, a discount code, and details about the discount.

The code also includes a script that listens for certain events and displays the popup when they occur. If the user's mouse leaves the window, the script adds the `rm-visible` class to the `rm-exit-intent-popup` div, which causes it to appear on the screen. The script also listens for the escape key being pressed or the close icon being clicked, and closes the popup if either of these events occur.

Finally, the script sets a timeout that displays the popup after a certain amount of time specified in the `popup_timeout` setting. If the user's mouse leaves the window before the timeout expires, the timeout is cancelled and the popup is displayed immediately.
