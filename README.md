This code is for a discount popup that appears on a Shopify store when a user is about to leave the page. The popup is triggered either when the user's mouse cursor moves outside of the page (an `exit intent`), or after a certain amount of time has passed.

The code first checks if the product being viewed has a specific tag (specified in the `settings.popup_tag` variable) and if the `settings.show_discount_popup` variable is set to true. If both conditions are met, the code generates the HTML for the discount popup. The HTML includes an img element for the store's logo, a `close` icon, and a p element for the discount message, code, and details.

The JavaScript listens for various events that could trigger the popup to appear. If the user's mouse cursor moves outside of the page (an `exit intent`), the script adds the `rm-visible` class to the popup element, causing it to appear on the page. If a certain amount of time has passed (specified in the `settings.popup_timeout` variable), the script adds the `rm-visible` class to the popup element after the specified timeout.

The script also listens for the user to click on the `close` icon or press the escape key. If either of these events occurs, the script removes the `rm-visible` class from the popup element, causing it to disappear.

Finally, the script adds an event listener for clicks on the page mask (the semi-transparent background behind the popup). If the user clicks on the mask, the `rm-visible` class is removed from the popup element, causing it to disappear.
